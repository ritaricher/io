      <description>Reading Camus&amp;rsquo;s books always fills me with a sense of dread. His descriptions of absurdity and nihilism, along with his analysis of the meaning of life, often lead me to reflect deeply on my own existence. Every conscious person questions the meaning of their life. After all, if life has no meaning, why not end it now rather than go through the repetitive, meaningless days until death? It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder he said, &amp;ldquo;There is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;The Wisdom of Life&amp;rsquo; is a significant work by the famous German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. In this book, Schopenhauer explores the essence of human existence and the suffering that accompanies it. With his unique pessimistic outlook, he argues that life is fundamentally composed of various forms of suffering, and the pursuit of happiness is often in vain. Instead, he believes that we should focus on reducing suffering. This book is not only a profound reflection on life but also an in-depth analysis of human nature.</description>
