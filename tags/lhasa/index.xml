      <description>China&amp;rsquo;s Sichuan-Tibet Highway 318 is a popular and classic self-driving route, favored by many adventurers. It typically refers to the section of National Highway 318 from Chengdu to Lhasa, covering about 2,000 kilometers. The southern Sichuan-Tibet line, located along the 30th parallel north, begins at Ya&amp;rsquo;an and diverges from National Highway 108. As it winds westward, it crosses Erlang Mountain and is renowned as &amp;ldquo;China&amp;rsquo;s Scenic Avenue.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;For a self-driving trip to Lhasa, it is recommended to start from Chengdu and pass through Luding—Kangding—Xinduqiao—Yajiang—Litang—Batang—Zuogong—Basu—Ranwu—Bomi—Motuo—Nyingchi, and finally reach Lhasa, the capital of Tibet.</description>
