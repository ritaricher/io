      <description>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a seminal science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick, published in 1968. Set in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear war, the narrative explores profound themes of humanity, empathy, and the nature of consciousness through the lens of a dystopian future where androids, or &amp;ldquo;andys,&amp;rdquo; coexist with humans. This work has not only influenced the genre of science fiction but has also prompted philosophical inquiries into what it means to be human.</description>
