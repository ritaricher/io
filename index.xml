      <title>Death is inevitable, but whether one can maintain happiness until death is filled with uncertainty</title>

      <description>Reading Camus&amp;rsquo;s books always fills me with a sense of dread. His descriptions of absurdity and nihilism, along with his analysis of the meaning of life, often lead me to reflect deeply on my own existence. Every conscious person questions the meaning of their life. After all, if life has no meaning, why not end it now rather than go through the repetitive, meaningless days until death? It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder he said, &amp;ldquo;There is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;The Wisdom of Life&amp;rsquo; is a significant work by the famous German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. In this book, Schopenhauer explores the essence of human existence and the suffering that accompanies it. With his unique pessimistic outlook, he argues that life is fundamentally composed of various forms of suffering, and the pursuit of happiness is often in vain. Instead, he believes that we should focus on reducing suffering. This book is not only a profound reflection on life but also an in-depth analysis of human nature.</description>

      <description>Enforce HTTPS — Unavailable for your site because your domain is not properly configured to support HTTPS 第一种方法： 如果您使用的是Cloudflare，则需要禁用其代理功能&#xA;Cloudflare默认启用其HTTP/DNS代理功能，这意味着GitHub无法查看生成HTTPS证书所需的DNS记录。您需要为指向GitHub的任何DNS记录禁用此功能。&#xA;首先，请确保您已根据我们的帮助文档中的说明在Cloudflare中设置了DNS记录&#xA;要禁用Cloudflare的DNS/HTTP代理，您需要登录到您的Cloudflare帐户，导航到您的域名的DNS设置页面，然后单击与您的GitHub Pages域相关的任何DNS记录旁边的橙子云图标。&#xA;云图标应该会变成灰色，如果正确禁用。&#xA;配置证书后，您就可以通过选中“强制HTTPS”复选框来强制HTTPS。请记住，请求HTTPS证书可能需要一个小时左右的时间，所以如果您遵循这些步骤但仍然遇到问题，这通常就是原因。&#xA;如果您不确定如何解决这些SSL错误，请联系您的DNS提供商，或查看我们的自定义域故障排除指南。&#xA;免责声明：禁用HTTP/DNS代理可能会干扰其他Cloudflare服务。&#xA;如果您在您的网站上使用其他Cloudflare服务，我们无法保证这些服务将继续工作。要获得更多帮助，我建议联系Cloudflare的支持团队。&#xA;第二种方法： 从github page设置中删除自定义域，删除DNS设置，然后重新添加它。&#xA;这并没有立即工作，但九个小时后，证书颁发，我的网站开始通过HTTPS提供服务。&#xA;因此，我建议任何人有困难，首先尝试删除和重新添加他们的自定义域，如果他们还没有这样做。其次，可能需要一点耐心-这个过程可能需要几个小时。</description>
